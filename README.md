# MachineLearningP2



Language: R

IDE: RStudio

This is the my final project done for my Machine Learning course. The goal of this product was to use regression and classification models on a larger dataset (100,000+ objects). 

The first dataset used was related to pollution. With this dataset I used linear regression, kNN, and decision trees in order to predict O3.AQI or ozone air quality index.

The second dataset used was bank simulation data. With this dataset I used logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and decision trees. The goal for these models were to see if I could predict fraudlant activity.
